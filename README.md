# robot_control
The total project of the Marble Finding Robot project.
The project was developed by Thomas Agervig Jensen, Stefan Bj√∏rn Gunnarsson og Janus Syrak Hansen.
In order to replicate the tests that was performed throughout, please refer to the specific test documents included in each folder.
These will describe how to alter the code, in order to perform them in the same manner as we did.
The first Q Learning tests were performed in the framework of q_learning_simple, and the last was performed with q_learning_2.
