The purpose of the test is to clerify the complications of the tendency of the robot driving to the right or left in certain situations. 
It is previously observed that in a senario where the robot is driwing towards a target position directly towards the Center of the target 
with an obstacle between and the robot is driwing from the intial position X = 0 and Y = 0 and with the center of the object and target in Y = 0, 
that the robot will turn right almost evry time. 

In the test the robot will drive to two fixed target positions in fixed order.
The test is run with the robot from an inital pose of 0.0 towards target1 at (12,0) and target2 at (-20,2)
The target is set in main goalX,goalY,gaolX2,goalY2

an abstract object is implementet in the bigworld file towards the first obstacle along with servel unit_cylinder object towards the second target
The test is run with the bigworld file in fuzzy-controller-final-finalTest/big.

The test will answer true if the robot choosees the same route for each testrun and reaches both targets (it is observed in intial runs that there is a tendency of the robot driving the same route is)
